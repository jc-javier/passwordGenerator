# Password Generator

A password generator project I created to practice programming in Python and exploring 
PySide6 functionality.

Features:
- Generate passwords with all or one of the following:
  - Numbers
  - Uppercase Letters
  - Lowercase Letters
  - Special characters (e.g. {}()!@#$)
- Choose length of password between 12 and 50 characters
- Copy generated password to clipboard
- Clear clipboard
- Hide/Show generated password
